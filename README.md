# CS767 Final Project

![](pikachu-anim-compressed.gif)

Object detection is detecting instances of objects of a particular class within an image. AI-based object detection is already widely used for visual inspection in the manufacturing, medical, and construction industries. The face detection function of smartphone cameras and pedestrian detection in automated driving are examples of object detection applications that are also used in our daily lives. So, I am interested in whether object detection works effectively for fictitious entities rather than people or objects. In this project, I construct a Neural Network model to detect Pikachu from a particular scene in one of my favorite movies, "Detective Pikachu." [[1]](#1) This project aims to learn how to fine-tune the pre-trained NN model and deepen our understanding of object detection through this coding.
